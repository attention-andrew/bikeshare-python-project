### Bike Share Data Analysis

#### Description
Given real data about bicycle-sharing systems, I created a Python script using NumPy and Pandas to uncover patterns between 3 large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Utilized multiple statistic computations to analyze:
- Popular times of travel
- Popular stations and trips
- Trip duration
- User info  
*The Analysis of these data points can drive decisions to optimize the bike share business.*

### Files used
